  "body": "## About Gameki 2\r\n\r\nGameki is an online interface for collaboratively editing LARPs, allowing multiple GMs to contribute without getting in each other's way.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Interactive, real-time collaborative editing in your web browser, powered by [Etherpad Lite](http://etherpad.org/).\r\n* Based on [GameTeX](http://web.mit.edu/kenclary/Public/Guild/GameTeX/) for powerful parameterization abilities and full GameTeX compatibility.\r\n* Automatic Subversion syncing: GMs can edit with Subversion and a text editor if they wish.\r\n* See and edit sheet metadata alongside the sheet text.\r\n* Send casting hint or packet emails, prod sheets, and do interactive casting (via [Gameki Tools](http://xavidotron.github.io/gameki-tools/)).\r\n* Runs on [XVM](http://xvm.mit.edu/) (or presumably any cloud provider).\r\n\r\n### Future Features\r\n\r\n* Syntax highlighting, with an angry red for non-macro'd pronouns.\r\n* Support for interactive runtime websites.\r\n\r\n### Non-Goals\r\n\r\n* Keeping Subversion history clean.\r\n* Having a different markup language or data/production model like Gameki 1 did.\r\n* Running on scripts.mit.edu; unfortunately, it's hard to make Etherpad Lite and Scripts play nice.",
